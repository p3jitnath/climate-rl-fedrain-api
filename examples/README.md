# Example Climate Models

This folder contains example climate models for use with the FedRAIN API:

- `climate_model_scbc.py`: Simple Climate Box Model (SCBC)
- `climate_model_rce.py`: Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE) Model
- `climate_model_ebm.py`: Energy Balance Model (EBM)

Each script is a starting point and can be extended to demonstrate integration with FedRAIN RL agents.
